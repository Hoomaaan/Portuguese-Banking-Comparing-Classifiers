# Portuguese Banking-Comparing Classifiers

**Business Problem**

_Background:_
The marketing landscape for financial institutions has evolved significantly, especially in the era of digital communication. For our current assignment, we are delving into the domain of a Portugese banking institution that has conducted multiple marketing campaigns aimed at promoting long-term deposit products. The objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can discern whether a customer is likely to subscribe to the bank's long-term deposit offering.

_Problem Statement:_
The central challenge revolves around optimizing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. The bank seeks to enhance its strategic approach by identifying customers who are more inclined to subscribe to long-term deposit products. The problem is inherently binary: a customer either subscribes ('yes') or does not ('no'). This binary classification task allows us to predict and understand the factors influencing customer decisions, thereby refining future marketing strategies.

The predictive model holds substantial significance for the bank. Accurately identifying customers likely to subscribe enables targeted and personalized marketing efforts, optimizing resource allocation and increasing the overall success rate of marketing campaigns. By predicting subscription outcomes, the bank can tailor its approach, allocate resources more efficiently, and enhance customer engagement.


**Linear Regression**

Description:
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. In the context of your assignment, it might not be the ideal choice for a binary classification task like predicting customer subscription. However, it can serve as a benchmark for more complex models.

Strengths:

Simplicity and interpretability.
Efficient for tasks with a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
Considerations:

Assumes a linear relationship, which might not capture complex patterns in the data.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Description:
KNN is a versatile and simple algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. In your assignment, KNN could capture local patterns in the data and might perform well, especially if there are discernible clusters.

Strengths:

No assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
Effective in capturing non-linear patterns.
Considerations:

Can be sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features.
Computationally expensive for large datasets.

**Decision Tree**

Description:
A Decision Tree is a tree-like model where each internal node represents a decision based on the value of a particular feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable, making them suitable for understanding feature importance.

Strengths:

Easy to understand and interpret.
Can capture complex non-linear relationships.
Considerations:

Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
Sensitivity to small variations in the data.


**Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

Description:
SVC is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is especially useful when classes are not linearly separable.

Strengths:

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Versatile with different kernel functions for non-linear relationships.
Considerations:

Sensitivity to the choice of kernel and hyperparameters.
Can be computationally intensive for large datasets.

**Findings and Future steps**

In our analysis, the Decision Tree emerges as the most effective model based on precision, accuracy, and AUC_ROC metrics. The model demonstrates superior capability in distinguishing between majority and minority classes, as evidenced by the detailed examination of the confusion matrix.

Following closely is the Linear Regression model, showcasing commendable performance. Its ability to discern between the two classes, as highlighted in the confusion matrix, surpasses other models. Notably, Linear Regression maintains strong precision and recall scores while consistently achieving a higher AUC_ROC value compared to alternative models.

A significant observation is the variation in the time required for fine-tuning the models. Notably, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) fine-tuning process consumes the most time, approximately 455 minutes. In contrast, the grid search for the Decision Tree yields enhanced results in a fraction of that time, taking less than 2 minutes. Despite K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) requiring around 6 minutes, the Decision Tree outperforms it, underscoring the efficiency of the fine-tuning process.

Comparing the current models to the initial set, which considered fewer features and omitted class weights during training, the enhanced models exhibit improved performance. However, there is still room for refinement. Opportunities for improvement include feature selection, defining class weights, and exploring data oversampling/undersampling techniques. Additionally, fine-tuning hyperparameters using methods like randomized search or RandomizedSearchCV could further optimize model performance.

While the current models represent a significant improvement, these observations lay the groundwork for future enhancements and refinements in pursuit of an even more robust predictive model.
